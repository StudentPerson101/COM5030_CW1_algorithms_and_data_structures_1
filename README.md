# COM5030_CW1_algorithms_and_data_structures_1

Project on algorithms and data structures.

This is a small C++ program that enables the user to search through the computer science BSc courses that the university has either by checking what module each course has or by checking which courses have a selected module.

The version fit for use is the final version which is the .cpp file titled 'proj1 - v6 - (run this).cpp'

The program uses only standard C++ libraries so as long as the host contains a C++ compiler that the program can access, the code should run without issue.

Using the module-search feature becomes easier after first viewing the module index which you are prompted to access by the program. There is also a text file called 'comp modules.txt' that contains the full module index that could could retrieve and open instead.
